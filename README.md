Color Picker

Overview
This app was created in order for me to practice using API's in applications I build. The data for this project is drawn from the Color API

Features
The application takes a particular color using the browser's inbuilt color picker and the user can select a specific mode of color they desire.
When the button is clicked application will then return several shades of the color picked with their value.
